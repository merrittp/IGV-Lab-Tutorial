# IGV-Lab-Tutorial

In this repository are the files we are going to be using to experiment with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).

Before we begin, please clone this repository to your computer and make sure IGV is downloaded and installed. You can find the download instructions here: https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download

There is also an online application for IGV that does not require a login, Java, or download. However, this tutorial will use the downloaded program and not the online website.
